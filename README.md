Backend software engineer passionate about building **scalable distributed systems**, **high-performance services**, and **developer tooling**.  
Experienced in **Rust**, **Go**, and **Python**, with a strong background in **blockchain infrastructure**, **virtual machines**, and **network data systems**.  
I enjoy designing clean, concurrent architectures and bringing complex backend ideas to life — from protocol-level execution engines to machine learning data generators.

## Objective
As a backend engineer with deep experience in **Rust-based system design**, **async execution models**, and **microservice orchestration**, I aim to contribute to engineering teams building **high-throughput, reliable, and secure distributed platforms**.  
My current focus is on **smart contract execution**, **validator and VM microservices**, and **low-latency RPC architectures**.  
I’m excited to continue growing as a backend developer, tackling challenges at the intersection of **networking, systems performance, and distributed computation**.

## Projects
- **Smart Contract Execution Engine (Rust)** — Designed and built a distributed VM and validator microservice architecture for executing WASM contracts via Cap’n Proto RPC.
- **rredis (Rust)** — In-memory key-value store implementing Redis protocol with async I/O, TTLs, pipelining, and observability.
- **Network Data Generator (Python)** — Created a synthetic graph-based network traffic generator to simulate realistic telemetry for ML anomaly detection.
- **Threat Detection System (Python + ELK)** — Developed a log ingestion and alerting system using Elastic Stack for threat pattern identification.
- **SOC Automation Project (Python + SOAR)** — Built automation workflows integrating Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle for incident response orchestration.
